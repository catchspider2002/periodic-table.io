## Element Details
This contains the text for individual element details like name reason, history, facts, applications and hazards. Below is a sample from Hydrogen element:

**Name Reason**
> From the Greek word *hydro* (water), and *genes* (forming)

**History**
> Henry Cavendish was the first to distinguish hydrogen from other gases in 1766 when he prepared it by reacting hydrochloric acid with zinc.<br><br>In 1670, English scientist Robert Boyle had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals.<br><br>French scientist Antoine Lavoisier later named the element hydrogen in 1783.

**Facts**
> Hydrogen is the primary component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets

**Applications**
> Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket fuel.<br><br>Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators.<br><br>Hydrogen's two heavier isotopes (deuterium and tritium) are used in nuclear fusion. Used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding.

**Hazards**
> Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to safety, from fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure form
