var ele1History="Henry Cavendish was the first to distinguish hydrogen from other gases in 1766 when he prepared it by reacting hydrochloric acid with zinc.<br><br>In 1670, English scientist Robert Boyle had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals.<br><br>French scientist Antoine Lavoisier later named the element hydrogen in 1783."
var ele2History="French astronomer Jules Janssen obtained the first evidence of helium during the solar eclipse of 1868.<br><br>Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland suggested the name helium for the new element.<br><br>In 1895, Sir William Ramsay discovered helium in the uranium mineral cleveite.<br><br>It was independently discovered in cleveite by Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet."
var ele3History="Lithium was discovered by Johann Arfvedson in 1817 when he was analyzing minerals from the island of Uto in Sweden.<br><br>The pure metal was isolated the following year by both Swedish chemist William Thomas Brande and English chemist Sir Humphry Davy working independently.<br><br>In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen."
var ele4History="Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium in the oxide form in both beryl and emeralds in 1798.<br><br>Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride.<br><br>The first commercially-successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt."
var ele5History="Boron compounds have been known for thousands of years, but the element was not discovered until 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by Gay-Lussac and Thenard.<br><br>Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard.<br><br>Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824."
var ele6History="Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations.<br><br>In 1772, Antoine Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water.<br><br>In 1779, Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed that graphite burned to form carbon dioxide and so must be another form of carbon."
var ele7History="Nitrogen is considered to have been discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it noxious air or fixed air.<br><br>It was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley.<br><br>In 1790 the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal named the element nitrogen."
var ele8History="Carl Wilhelm Scheele obtained oxygen by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777.<br><br>Joseph Priestley also prepared this new air by 1774.<br><br>The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion."
var ele9History="In 1529, Georigius Agricola described the use of fluorspar as a flux.<br><br>In 1670 Heinrich Schwandhard found that glass was etched when exposed to fluorspar treated with acid.<br><br>In 1810, French scientist Andre-Marie Ampere proposed that fluoric acid was a compound of hydrogen with a new element.<br><br>The element was finally isolated in 1886 by Henri Moissan."
var ele10History="Neon was discovered in 1898 by the British chemists Sir William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers in London.<br><br>It was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off.<br><br>After 1902, Georges Claude's company, Air Liquide, was producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business."
var ele11History="The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols.<br><br>It is a contraction of the element's new Latin name <i>natrium</i>, which refers to the Egyptian <i>natron</i>, a natural mineral salt primarily made of hydrated sodium carbonate.<br><br>In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy isolated sodium for the first time by electrolysis of dried sodium hydroxide, which had been very slightly moistened."
var ele12History="Scottish chemist Joseph Black recognized magnesium as an element in 1755.<br><br>Magnesium was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808, in London.<br><br>He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide.<br><br>Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831."
var ele13History="In 1761, Guyton de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the base in alum, and Antoine Lavoisier, in 1787, thought this to be the oxide of a still undiscovered metal.<br><br>Sir Humphry Davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum in 1808.<br><br>Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to isolate metallic aluminum in 1825 in impure form.<br><br>Friedrich Wöhler is generally credited with having isolated the metal in 1827."
var ele14History="In 1800, Sir Humphry Davy thought silica to be a compound and not an element; but in 1811, Gay Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard probably prepared impure amorphous silicon by heating potassium with silicon tetrafluoride.<br><br>In 1824 Jöns Jakob Berzelius prepared amorphous silicon by the same general method.<br><br>Henri Deville in 1854 first prepared crystalline silicon, the second allotropic form of the element."
